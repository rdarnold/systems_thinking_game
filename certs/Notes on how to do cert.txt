For the Sectigo cert (received in email)
- Must open/install the cert in FireFox
    Then, go to Options
    Privacy and Security
    Certificate->View Certificates
    Click on the Sectigo cert and click "Backup" 
    set password for **SystemsThinkingGame12
- Once I have the .p12 file, use Keystore Explorer to open it, and "Rename" to "ra_id" instead of "ross arnold's sectigo limited id"
