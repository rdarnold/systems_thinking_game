For the Sectigo cert (received in email)

(THIS IS THE OLD OUTDATED METHOD) 
- Must open/install the cert in FireFox
    Then, go to Options
    Privacy and Security
    Certificate->View Certificates
    Click on the Sectigo cert and click "Backup" 
    set password to **SystemsThinkingGame12
- Once I have the .p12 file, use Keystore Explorer to open it, and "Rename" to "ra_id" instead of "ross arnold's sectigo limited id"

(THIS IS THE NEW METHOD)
UPDATE:  FireFix no longer works, MUST USE IE
- Must open/install the cert in IE 8+
    Then, go to Settings->internet options
    Content
    Certificates
    Click on the Sectigo cert (at the bottom) and click "Export"
    Yes, export the private key
    (It will try to export as a *.pfx file; this is the SAME as a p12)
    set password to **SystemsThinkingTest12
    (It will export to Desktop by default)
    Rename the extension to p12
- Once I have the .p12 file, use Keystore Explorer to open it, and "Rename" to "ra_id" instead of the long string of characters and numbers under Entry Name
