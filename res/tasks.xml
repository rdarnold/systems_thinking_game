    If left alone, all the spinning shapes in this system will probably be destroyed.  Your goal is to 
    shift the state of the system so that the shapes multiply instead of being destroyed.  Create as many 
    shapes as you can!

    Your shape is the circled shape in the middle of the screen.  
    Your goal is to raise your shape's level as high as possible.
