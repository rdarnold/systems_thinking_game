        This game is part of a research project to help define and measure  
        complex problem-solving skills.  In this game, you’ll be asked to observe 
        and interact with a system of shapes and other things that move around the 
        screen and interact with each other.  Your gameplay data will be periodically 
        uploaded to a research server as you play the game.
        CRCRThe game consists of the following sections:
        CR- Demographic Survey (~10 minutes)
        CR- In-Game Tutorial (~5 minutes)
        CR- Gameplay: Four Shapes exercise (~20 minutes)
        CR- Gameplay: Chaos exercise (~20 minutes)
        CR- Feedback (~5 minutes)
        CR- Self-assessment (~15 minutes)
        CRCRThe entire experience will probably take at least an hour of concentrated time.

        The purpose of this game is to understand how people approach and solve certain 
        types of complex problems. During the game, you will be presented with a 
        set of scenarios.  In each scenario, there is a system which has a
        set of spinning shapes of various types, colors, sizes, and properties.  The scenario will 
        provide an objective for you to achieve within a certain number of turns.  
        CRCREach turn is an interval of several seconds during which the system moves forward 
        in time.  Before each turn of the task, you’ll be able to make changes to the system.  
        You’ll also be able to discover information 
        about the system through observation and experimentation. 
        CRCRThe bottom line is, learn about the system, and use that knowledge to change it 
        to do what you want.  CRCRThere are no wrong answers. Just do what you think makes the 
        most sense!  CRCRPlease enjoy!

        Each scenario consists of several shapes that move around screen and behave in certain ways, 
        some laws that restrict how things work, and other hidden variables.  It will be your job to try 
        to understand how this system works, answer questions about it, and make changes to make it behave 
        certain ways.

        Each turn in the game represents several seconds of time.  Between each turn
        you will have the opportunity to make changes to the system and observe and experiment to 
        learn more about the system.

        The point of this game is to figure out how a system works, and then make changes to make
        it do what you want. To do that, you'll need to know:CRCR
        1: Some things about how the system works.CR
        2: What things you should change.CR
        3: How much to change them (or in which direction).CRCR

    <info name="Observe">
        <name>Observe</name>
        <text>
        Observe how the system behaves over time.  Observations can only be performed starting from
        the default system, before you make any changes.  Thus they cannot be used to precisely predict
        how your changes will affect the system.  But, they can be used to try to figure out how the
        systems works or will work in the absence of any changes.

    <info name="Experiment">

        Devise experiments to test and learn about the system.  You can design an experiment that shows
        how a particular set of changes will affect the system over the course of one turn.  All experiments
        start from the original state of the system, and can only run for a single turn.
        CRCROnce you create an experiment, you can watch and re-watch it as many times as you
        want.  Or, you can create a new experiment, which will replace the old one.

        Make desired changes to the system, then proceed to the next turn in the task.  Each task has
        only a set number of turns, with a goal that you will be trying to achieve within those turns.
        CRCRWhen proceeding to the next turn, you will be presented with a set of sliders and selections
        that allow you to tweak the system as you wish.

        The angled shapes have a certain number of angles, size, color, spin speed, direction, 
        and other attributes.  Some of these attributes affect things strongly, while others have 
        little to no effect.  Try to pay attention to which is which.

        Shapes, in general, try to grow larger, with varying degrees of success.  If a shape 
        becomes too small it is destroyed permanently.  Try to pay attention to what happens
        when a shape becomes too large.

        <text>
        Small objects that look something like rain can be seen falling from one side of the screen to
        another (usually top to bottom).  Rain has variety of effects when impacting other 
        objects such as spinning shapes, spikes, and circles.  Understanding how the rain affects
        the other parts of the system is important.

        Shapes move around the screen based on a property called Gravity.  Try to pay attention to
        how it works and what causes it.

    <info name="Circles">

        <text>
        Try to pay attention to when and why circles, or "red balls" are created at the bottom
        of the screen, and why they multiply.  Can this phenomenon be exploited to your advantage?

        Depending on the Paradigm chosen, shapes either compete with each other (Competitive), 
        cooperate and work together (Cooperative), or ignore each other and do not interact 
        (Independent).
